# neural networks

1. [autoencoders](https://github.com/deepak6446/machine-learning/blob/master/DEEP_AUTOENCODERS/Untitled.ipynb): autoencoders are neural networks that aims to copy their inputs to their outputs. They work by compressing the input into a latent-space representation(encoders), and then reconstructing the output from this representation(decoders).
where: autoencoders are used for data denoising and dimensionality reduction.

# machine learning algorithms

1. [Gaussian Naive Bayes](https://github.com/deepak6446/machine-learning/blob/master/NAIVE_BAYES/Untitled.ipynb)
GNB is a Multinomial naive Bayes. it assumes that all the predictors are dependent of each other. but in most cases they are dependent.it can be used in cases where predictors are independent.
iris data [here]((https://github.com/deepak6446/machine-learning/blob/master/NAIVE_BAYES/Untitled.ipynb)) got 95.55 as compared to randomforest 97.77 [here](https://github.com/deepak6446/machine-learning/blob/master/radom_forest/irisDataset%20random%20forest.ipynb)
